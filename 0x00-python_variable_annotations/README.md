0x00-python_variable_annotations

Overview
The 0x00-python_variable_annotations project is a collection of Python scripts focusing on variable annotations. This project serves as an educational resource for developers looking to understand and implement variable annotations in Python code. Variable annotations are a feature introduced in Python 3.6, allowing developers to declare the types of variables in their code explicitly.

Features
Demonstrates the use of variable annotations in Python scripts.
Provides examples of annotating variables with different data types.
Highlights the benefits of using variable annotations for type hinting and code readability.
Includes exercises and solutions to reinforce learning.
